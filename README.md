# Do LLMs Understand Why We Write Diaries? A Method for Purpose Extraction and Clustering
## Abstract
Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting mean-ingful information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writ-ing, such as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922â€“1929) from the Prozhito digital archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the best performance, while a template-based baseline is signif-icantly less effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we ex-amine the types of errors made by the models, providing a deeper under-standing of their limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.
